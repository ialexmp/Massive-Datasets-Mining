# Data Mining Course

Instructor: [Teodora Sandra Buda](https://tbuda.github.io/)

These are materials for a twelve-weeks undergraduate course on **Data Mining**, and include two-hour lectures and two-hour practice sessions every week. They were developed for third year students of the bachelor degree on *Mathematical Engineering on Data Science* at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona.

* *"A very interesting subject for students of data science. In practice sessions, you complete your understanding of the theory concepts."* -- a student from the 2022 edition
* *"I could say this is the best subject I've had during the studies"* -- a student from the 2021 edition
* *"A lot of work in the practices, but it was helpful"* -- a student from the 2020 edition
* *"A lot of work. However, the theory and practice materials are excellent"* -- a student from the 2019 edition
