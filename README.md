## Presentation

Finding patterns in large datasets is one of the main tasks that a data scientist performs professionally. Data mining sits at the intersection of databases and statistics, and includes several steps from managing to pre-processing, cleaning, modeling, and performing inferences using data.

Data mining can be a challenging task. Data may not be formatted ideally for a purpose, or it may include noisy or missing data points. Datasets can be extremely large making even quadratic-time algorithms impractical. In many cases, the size of a dataset is unbounded and one needs to provide answers as new data elements keep arriving.

This course offers the students the possibility of learning fundamental data mining algorithms.

## Associated competences

**Basic competences**

CB3. That the students have the ability of collecting and interpreting relevant data (normally within their study area) to issue judgements which include a reflection about relevant topics of social, scientific or ethical nature.

**Transversal competences**

CT3. Applying with flexibility and creativity the acquired knowledge and adapting it to new contexts and situations.

**Specific competences**

RA.CE7.2 Recognizing the statistic techniques applied to data mining.

RA.CE9.2 Recognizing and applying data mining techniques.
